# Process Description for Raising Tractus-X Release Guideline Exceptions

## Objective

The process aims to establish a structured method for raising exceptions to the Tractus-X Release Guidelines (TRG) for the release automation tool. These exceptions are managed through pull requests (PRs) modifying the `exceptions.yaml` file. The system team will review these exceptions and make decisions accordingly.

1. **Identification of Exception:**
   - Before raising an exception, the requester must identify a specific guideline that needs to be exempted.

2. **Drafting a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Create a PR to propose the changes made to the [exceptions.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/main/release-automation/exceptions.yaml) file.
   - Provide a clear and descriptive title for the PR, summarizing the purpose of the exception(s).
   - In the PR description, elaborate on the reasons for requesting the exception(s) and any potential impact on the release process.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Based on the feedback and discussion, members will make a decision to either accept or decline the exception(s).
   - Once a decision has been reached, close the PR accordingly.
   - Ensure that all relevant stakeholders are informed of the outcome.

4. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Periodically review the process for raising exceptions and incorporate any lessons learned or feedback from stakeholders to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
